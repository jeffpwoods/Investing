Repo storing programs for my investment models. 

The Repo contains programs for the following (or will be added shortly as they are completed):

- Historic option data gathering from Alpha Vantage
- Random Forest option strategy model
- Cointegration pairs trading model
- Cross index (global arbitrage) model
- Value long-only model

The primary language used for data gathering, initial model building, and backtesting is Python with initial data coming from Alpha Vantage.
Once successfully backtested many of the models will be converted to a combination of Python and C++ for optimization. After completing the 
go-live models, the data and trading (some of which will be automated) will be sourced through IBKR.
